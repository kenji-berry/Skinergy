# Skinergy Desktop Uploader

This is the source code for the Skinergy desktop app that uploads your League of Legends skins to your Skinergy account.

## Why is this public?

Windows Defender flags PyInstaller executables pretty often. This repo is here so you can verify the code yourself if you dont trust the exe.

## What does it do?

1. Connects to your local League client (127.0.0.1)
2. Reads your owned skins
3. Uploads them to skinergy.lol

## Building it yourself

See [BUILD_PYTHON.md](BUILD_PYTHON.md)
